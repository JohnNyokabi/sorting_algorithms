## Requirements
gcc compilor
Ubuntu 20.04lTS

##Tasks

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm.
* It is expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements.

### [1. Insertion sort](./1-insertion_sort_list.c)
* Ffunction that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm. You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
* The function is expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements.

### [2. Selection sort](./2-selection_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm.
* It is expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements.

### [3. Quick sort](./3-quick_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm. You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
* The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
* It is expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements.

### [4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence](./100-shell_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence


### [5. Cocktail shaker sort](./101-cocktail_sort_list.c)
* Function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm


### [6. Counting sort](./102-counting_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Counting sort algorithm


### [7. Merge sort](./103-merge_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge sort algorithm


### [8. Heap sort](./104-heap_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm


### [9. Radix sort](./105-radix_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Radix sort algorithm


### [10. Bitonic sort](./106-bitonic_sort.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bitonic sort algorithm


### [11. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme](./107-quick_sort_hoare.c)
* Function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm


### [12. Dealer](./1000-sort_deck.c)
* Function that sorts a deck of cards. You are allowed to use the C standard library function qsort
